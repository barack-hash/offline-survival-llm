# Build Log — Offline Survival LLM Device

Every session gets an entry. Mistakes and challenges are the most
valuable content here — never sanitized, never skipped.

## 2026-09-15 — Phase 0: repo + logging scaffolding
**Goal:** Stand up the git repo, logging infrastructure, and GitHub remote before any build work (Phase 0 of IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
**Done:**
- Scaffolding (README, CLAUDE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, BUILD_PLAN.md, CORPUS_CHECKLIST.md, docs/, corpus/pd + corpus/own, scripts/ with setup.sh, rag_build.py, main.py, verify.py, keypad_serial.ino, .gitignore) already existed on disk; this session put it under version control.
- `git init -b main` in the project folder on the owner's Mac (not the Pi — see Mistakes).
- Verified .gitignore with `git check-ignore -v`: models/, corpus/own/, venv/, index.faiss, chunks.pkl all correctly ignored.
- First commit of scaffolding; created public repo barack-hash/offline-survival-llm via `gh repo create` and pushed.
**Mistakes/Challenges:**
- `git add -A` staged macOS `.DS_Store` files (root and corpus/). The provided .gitignore didn't cover them because the plan assumed work happens on the Pi (Linux). Fix: appended `.DS_Store` to .gitignore and `git rm --cached` the staged copies.
- Environment mismatch: this session runs on the owner's Mac, but Phases 1+ (apt, raspi-config, vcgencmd, llama.cpp build) must run on the Pi 5 itself. Decision: do Phase 0 here where `gh` is already authenticated; the Pi will `git clone` the repo to start Phase 1.
**Improvements/Decisions:**
- Repo created public, as the plan specifies — safe because .gitignore keeps models and copyrighted scans (corpus/own/) local by construction.
**Hardware/Tools used:** Owner's Mac only (git, gh CLI). No Pi or Arduino hardware touched.
**Next:** Phase 1 on the Raspberry Pi 5: clone the repo, record system info in docs/HARDWARE.md, apt full-upgrade, enable SPI, log idle/load temperatures.
